# OWL: Orbial Watch Launcher

*A Playdate game project for Duke GDDI*  

---

## 🎮 Game Overview
**OWL** is a missile defense–inspired arcade game for the Playdate handheld.  
The player uses the **crank and d-pad** to aim a reticle and intercept incoming missiles before they reach the city at the bottom of the screen.  

The name **OWL** is an acronym (Orbial Watch Launcher), used as the thematic anchor for the project.
