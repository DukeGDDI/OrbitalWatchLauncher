# OWL: Orbial Watch Launcher

*A Playdate game project for Duke GDDI*  

---

## 🎮 Game Overview
**OWL** is a missile defense–inspired arcade game for the Playdate handheld.  
The player uses the **crank and d-pad** to aim a reticle and intercept incoming missiles before they reach the city at the bottom of the screen.  

The name **OWL** is an acronym (Orbial Watch Launcher), used as the thematic anchor for the project.

## 🕹️ Core Gameplay Loop
1. **Scan the sky** — rotate and extend the reticle using crank + buttons.  
2. **Mark a target** — press `Up` on the d-pad to lock in a target location.  
3. **Fire interceptors** — missiles launch from the base to the chosen point.  
4. **Protect the city** — stop incoming enemy missiles before they hit.  
5. **Repeat** — difficulty ramps with increasing wave speed and complexity.
